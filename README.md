# AirTag Customer Insights & Product Feasibility Analysis
## During my AI/ML internship at Lin & S Technologies, I generated realistic dummy data using the Faker library to simulate customer behavior and product usage patterns. I assessed the accuracy of the dataset using anomaly detection techniques and visualized trends through insightful data visualizations. Furthermore, I built a Linear Regression model to predict the potential success of the product if manufactured in India at a 20% reduced production cost, analyzing residuals to validate predictions. This project combined data simulation, machine learning, and business feasibility analysis to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
